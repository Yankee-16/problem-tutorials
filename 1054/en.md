# LightOj 1054 - Efficient Pseudo Code
[Problem Statement](http://lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1054)
## Summary
You'll be given two integers, `n` and `m`. You have to print the sum of all divisors of n<sup>m</sup>, modulo `1000000007`.  

## Hint
I highly recommend trying the problem [LightOj 1336 - Sigma Function](http://lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1336), or at the very least, read the statement carefully before trying this problem.  
If you read that problem, you'll come to know about this formula:  
![Sigma Function](https://i.ibb.co/KyhN69p/Sigma-Function.png)  
where `Ïƒ(n)` is the sum of divisors of `n`.  
From this formula, we can see that we only need the Prime factors of n<sup>m</sup> and how many times each prime factors appear. This seems a little difficult task since n<sup>m</sup> can be a huge number. Let's see how we can solve this part of the problem.  
Let's factorize `6`. The primes are `2, 3`.  
Now factorize `6`<sup>`2`</sup> = `36`. The primes are `2, 2, 3, 3`.  
How about `6`<sup>`3`</sup> = `216`?  

The primes are `2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3`.  

Did you notice any pattern?  

Yes, the count of primes are multiplied. If you think and observe a little, you'll find out that n<sup>m</sup> will have all the prime factors of `n`, no extra primes, and each primes factor will appear `m` times more than it appeared in `n`.  

So now all you have to do is to factorize `n`, count the frequency of prime factors, then multiply each factors frequency by `m`.  
Now you can solve this problem using the formula given before.  

You'll also need Bigmod and Modular Inverse to solve this problem.

#### C++
```c++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

typedef long long LL;

LL mod = 1000000007;

vector<LL> primes;
map<LL, LL> times;

LL bigmod (LL b, LL p, LL m)
{
    if (p==0) return 1;
    if (p%2==0) {
        LL x=bigmod(b, p/2, m)%m;
        return (x*x)%m;
    }
    else return (b%m * bigmod(b, p-1, m))%m;
}
 
LL inv_mod(LL a, LL m) {
    return bigmod(a, m-2, m);
}

void factorization(long long n) {
	if (n % 2 == 0) {
		primes.push_back(2);
	    while (n % 2 == 0) {
	        times[2]++;
	        n /= 2;
	    }
	}
    for (long long d = 3; d * d <= n; d += 2) { 
    	if (n % d == 0) {
    		primes.push_back(d);
	        while (n % d == 0) {
	            times[d]++;
	            n /= d;
	        }
	    }
    }
    if (n > 1) {
    	if (!times[n])
	        primes.push_back(n);
	    times[n]++;
    }
}

int main()
{
  	int t, ca=1;
  	cin>>t;
  	while (t--) {
  		primes.clear();
  		times.clear();
  		LL n, m;
  		cin>>n>>m;

  		factorization(n);
  		for (auto i: primes) {
  			times[i] *= m;
  		}

  		LL ans = 1;

  		for (auto i: primes) {
  			LL now = bigmod(i, times[i] + 1, mod);
  			now -= 1;
  			if (now < 0)
  				now += mod;
  			LL low = inv_mod(i - 1, mod);
  			now *= low;
  			ans = ((ans % mod) * (now % mod)) % mod;
  		}

  		cout<<"Case "<<ca++<<": "<<ans<<endl;
  	}

    return 0;
}
```

Happy Coding ^_^
